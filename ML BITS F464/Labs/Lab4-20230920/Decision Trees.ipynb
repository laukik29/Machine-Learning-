    "- **Entropy**: Entropy is a measure of the randomness in the information being processed. The higher the entropy, the harder it is to draw any conclusions from that information. In other words, higher entropy means higher uncertainty. Entropy is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H(X) = \\mathbb{E} [- \\log p(X)] =  -\\sum_{x \\in X} p(x) \\log p(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p(x_i)$ is the probability of the $i^{th}$ outcome. For example, if we have a coin, the probability of getting heads is $p(x_i) = 0.5$ and the probability of getting tails is $p(x_i) = 0.5$. Therefore, the entropy of the coin is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H(X) = -0.5 \\log 0.5 - 0.5 \\log 0.5 = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Information Gain**: Information gain is the measure of the difference in entropy from before to after the set $S$ is split on an attribute $A$. In other words, how much uncertainty in $S$ was reduced after splitting set $S$ on attribute $A$. Information gain is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$IG(S, A) = H(S) - \\sum_{t \\in T} \\frac{|t|}{|S|} H(t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $S$ is the set of all samples at the current node, $A$ is an attribute being tested, $T$ is the set of all possible subsets of $S$ resulting from splitting on attribute $A$, and $H(t)$ is the entropy of subset $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main essence of the ID3 algorithm is to select the attribute that has the highest information gain to split the data at each node. The algorithm will stop when all attributes have been used or when all instances of the node belong to the same class. (i.e. the entropy is zero)."
